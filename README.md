# Getting an account

To get an account on the Tigress system have your faculty advisor
email David Luet with a request for a new account on `tiger`.  

An account on the `tigercpu` cluster gives you access to:

-   `tigercpu`: the cluster,
-   `tigressdata`: a visualization node,
-   `jupyter.rc`: a JupyterHub host.

# Running Jupyter notebook

-   The easiest way to run Jupyter notebooks is to use [jupyter.rc](./jupyterhub.md).
